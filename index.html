            <div class="project-desc">In this game, you control a mouse cursor that encircles enemies with its trail to score points and extend the time limit. I primarily worked on this project as a programmer.</div>

            <div class="project-title">Sheep Toss (BRGD 2020)</div>
            <div class="project-desc">Sheep Toss is a rhythm game that involves, as you may guess, tossing sheep! Hitting the correct keys along with the beat determines how far you'll be able to launch the sheep. I led most of the programming work on this project as part of the Brown RISD Game Developers club.</div>

            <div class="project-title">Devil's Dice (Mini Jam 83: Dread)</div>
            <div class="project-desc">Devil's Dice is my most recent game made for a game jam. I developed the entire game within a 72 hour time limit. As part of the rules of the game jam, I had to incorporate dice into the project, so I made a dungeon crawler where dice act as a health system. Overall, I am very proud of how this game turned out, and will likely return to work on it in the near future!</div>

            <div class="project-title">Mosquito Graffiti (MashUp Game Jam 2)</div>
            <div class="project-desc">Mosquito Graffiti is the second game jam game I worked on. The theme for te 72-hour game jam was "unconventional means," so my concept for this game was trying to paint graffiti by swatting mosquitos against a wall. Although I did not polish the game as much as I would have liked, I had fun trying out exploring this idea for a game!</div>

            <div class="project-title">Ball and Chain Parkour (GMTK Game Jam 2021)</div>
            <div class="project-desc">This was the first game jam game I worked on! Ball and Chain Parkour is a fast-paced 2D platformer, where the player is attached to heavy ball and chain that they can throw to move around. I gained a lot of experience working under both time and design constraints (the game jam's theme was "joined together" and had a 48 hour time limit). </div>
